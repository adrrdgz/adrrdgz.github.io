      <p>hello, im adrian and im nonbinary, trixic, and asexual <sup>(any pronouns)</sup> and i was born in 2003.</p>
      <p>i know a lot of things about programming, open source software, and much more!! i am always promoting open source software and open hardware, i like old classic laptops to flash linux on it!! <b>my favorite computer/laptop is the "olpc-x01", mainly because of its size, functions and of course, the linux and open source sofware that it uses. i hope someday i can buy one and flash debian with gnome on it.</b> i am always happy to share oss with other people.</p>
      <p>thats the reason why i chose to make my own website, to share helpful guides, tutorials, or reviews, all regarding open source software. i also post about much more casual topics!!</p>

      <h1>olpc: an interesting project that tried to bring linux to young people & schools</h1>
      <h2>25/02/2024</h2>
      <h2>tags: linux, distro, laptop, hardware, open source, free software</h2>
      <p><i>olpc: one laptop per child</i> was a non-profit initiative that consisted of giving cool and affordable laptops to children all around the world in order to give intelligence to those kids.</p>
      <p>this initiative began in the year 2005, it began in miami, florida. the sad thing about this initiative is that the average laptop price around that time was 1 thousand american dollars,which is a lot!! so that's why those guys had to create their own laptops which had to be extremely cheap, and they made the <i>olpc-xo</i> laptop, which is also known as the <i>100 american dollars laptop</i>, which, to be honest is very cheap. this initiative thus was funded by sponsors such as amd, ebay, google, red hat, and quanta. sadly, after really bad sales, this foundation shut down in 2014, which is bad because the laptops were very pretty</p>
      <h1>the laptop's' specs</h1>
      <ul>
          <li>size: smol honestly</li>
          <li>power option: solar panel</li>
          <li>cpu: 433 mhz with amd graphics</li>
          <li>256 mb of ram</li>
          <li>operating system: fedora based distrbution running the <i>sugar</i> desktop environment, all open source</li>

      <h1>templeos, an honest review and how it was possible</h1>
      <h2>21/02/2024</h2>
      <h2>tags: open source, programming, c programming, operating system</h2>
      <p><img src="templeos.png" style="float: right;" alt="screenshot of templeos" width="600"></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px;"><sup><b>Terry A. Davis, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</b></sup></p>
      <p>templeos is an operating system made by software engineer <b>terry a davis</b>, who sadly had schizophrenia and would go on rants and insult people. but he did a very amazing operating system, despite his mental problems and fogness, he wrote the entire operating system by himself and made it both open source and public domain. he also made his own compiler and programming language <b>holy C</b>, which allows 3d graphics and other very cool things. sadly he became homeless and lived on his van for 3 years before passing away in an accident.</p>
      <p>he contributed a lot to the hobbyist programmer commnunity and helped people code stuff of their own, and despite problems and things terry said. his brilliance and knowledge of code is astonishing and amazing.</p>
      <h1>the operating system!!</h1>
      <p>templeos consists of mostly ascii characters arranged in such a way that they form a graphical user interface with both windows and a cursor. it has a few games built in which use the HOLY C language to work, sadly it doesnt have any networking or file sharing capabilities, which meant it was very hard to hack it or crack it. terry, would often suggest the people running templeos to dual boot to another open source operating system, like linux in order to both enjoy templeos and use network capabilities with linux.</p>

      <p>openstreetmaps is a pretty cool protocol that uses volunteers and other people that map the entire world, its been recorded in most, if not all, countries. thats what makes it great, its truly free, truly open, and helps people & communities.</p>
      <p>sadly in a lot of countries, data about people and culture, streets, etc, is often private and has to be asked from an external person and they arent open by themselves (not visible to the public)</p>
      <p>most openstreetmaps volunteers not only trace maps or find streets. sometimes they also do cool stuff like knowing the schedule, date, and more of public transport, knowing which places are and aren't safe.</p>
      <h1>openstreetmap is nice, why?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>open for anyone</li>
        <li>free and open data</li>
        <li>gratis (no price)</li>
        <li>volunteer-only</li>
        <li>offline use</li>
        <li>most streets are almost mapped</li>
        <li>volunteer-only method makes it faster to map places</li>
        <li>open source software</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>but... can i just volunteer myself and map stuff that hasnt been mapped?</b></p>
      <p>yes!! thats an awesome question, any person, no matter the knowledge or programming level, can contribute and trace any place, that makes it very valuable. because anyone can just go to any place (legally of course!!) and map it.</p>

      <h1>the chromium dinosaur offline and how open source projects make people think theyre from proprietary software</h1>
      <h2>09/02/2024</h2>
      <h2>tags: chromium, open source, dino game, google, chrome</h2>
      <p>chromium (or otherwise known as google chromium) is the open source/free software version <b>google chrome</b>, both google chrome and chromium share a lot of things together, since chromium was made by google themselves, google chrome isnt very different from chromium.</p>
      <p>but lets talk about whats in the title, and u know what it is!! if you are a google chrome or chromium user, u may notice that sometimes when you are offline, the site displayed will tell u that you are offline and will show cute dinosaur pixelart. well <b>this is an easter egg!!</b>, press space and u will begin to play a simple running game in which <b>u control the dinosaur and you are running through the northern mexican desert (which fun fact, dinosaurs lived there for thousands of years!!) jumping cactuses and crouching when u see pterodactyls.</b></p>
      <p>it became a staple of not only internet culture, but browser culture in general, while i dont think firefox uses the dino easter egg, a lot of chromium based browsers do, and im sure they have to keep a lot of chromium easter eggs bcus otherwise google could sue them since they arent following chromiums license (bsd-3).</p>
      <p><b>its a fun easter egg and a very nice thing since that game is completely open source too, yea!! thank you google!!!</b></p>

      <p><b>termcolor? colored import from termcolor?? not anymore!!</b></p>
      <p>open up your terminal please, i will teach u how to do it.</p>
      <p>open up python from the terminal and type this first 'TGREEN = '\033[32m'' without the first quotation marks pls!!</p>
      <p>then, dont use that variable yet please!! now type 'ENDCOMMAND = '\033[m'' <b>(this makes the input command go back to the default color, it wont stay green!!)</b></p>
      <h2>actually using it on our code and software, applying the variables</h2>
      <p>in the command line type the following print line <b>'print (TGREEN + 'ur text here, green of course!!', ENDCOMMAND)'</b></p>
      <p>and when u execute it. your code will be green and the input will be the default color, this is a great option for people who want to write software but dont want to tell people what modules to install!! yes its so nice!!</p>

      <ul>
        <li>sudo apt update [checks for updates of the packages used by linux, which, uses debian as the main virtual machine]</li>
        <li>sudo apt upgrade [upgrades the packages]</li>
        <li>[note: its important to always type these first two commands when opening a linux terminal, for they will keep everything stable]</li>
        <li>sudo apt install firefox-esr && sudo apt install chromium [the "&&" means that two commands will be executed one after another, in this case, both commands install firefox and vanilla chromium]</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>running debian from android</h1>

      <p style="margin: 10px;"><sup><b>Rprpr, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</b></sup></p>
      <p>debian is one of the oldest operating systems that are based on linux, since its open source, its been built by the community and by a lot of developers, which means that theres a way of running on your android device without paying anything, not even rooting!!</p>
      <p>debian was made in 1994 by american engineer ian murdock, ever since, its been built by a lot of people and its still worked on, the current version is <b>bookworm, or debian 12</b>. and we will be using that version.</p>
      <h1>what we will need</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>andronix</li>
        <li>rvnc viewer</li>
        <li>termux (download it from the f-droid store)</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>basics of andronix!!</h1>
      <p>after installing andronix from the google play store, we will open it, we tap on the button that says "linux distribution", and then tap on "debian", then we tap on "desktop environment", using a desktop environment is useful because we will see the graphical interface.</p>
      <p>after this, a list of various desktop environments will appear. <b>what is a desktop environment?</b> in simple terms, its just the way graphical elements are displayed, its the graphic user interface that will be used. for this test, we will use "xfce", which is the most similar to windows and easiest to use.</p>
      <h1>setting up debian on termux</h1>
      <p>the next page will say "termux execution", and a text will be copied to your clipboard, this is useful.</p>
      <p>we copy that command and then open termux and paste it on the terminal and press enter. it will load and a list will start appearing, dont worry, this is normal, its installing.</p>
      <p>when the script finally gets installed, everything on the termux screen will be cleared and youll get a username like <b>root@localhost</b></p>
      <p>we go back to andronix and tap on the orange button that says "next", we have to be on a page that says "start vnc server", in that page, another command will be copied to our clipboard, we open termux while we are on the debian shell and paste it there, the command is <b>vncserver-start</b></p>
      <h1>using rvnc viewer</h1>
      <p>open <b>rvnc viewer</b> and on the main screen tap on the green button with the "+" sign. it will ask you to make a new connection, type "localhost:1" and give it a name.</p>
      <p>now we just tap on the green button that says <b>connect</b>.</p>
      <p>wait a few seconds and... now youre running debian on your phone!! its great!</p>
      <b>if there are problems or bugs, please visit <a href="https://andronix.app">andronix.app</a> and there are more docs there for help.</b>

      <h1>chromeos review</h1>
      <h2>10/01/2024</h2>
      <h2>tags: chromeos, google, linux, review</h2>
      <p><img src="chromiumos.png" style="float: right;" alt="screenshot of chromiumos" width="610"></p>
      <p style="float: right; margin-right: 10px;"><sup><b>The chromium authors/Google, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</b></sup></p>
      <h1>what is chromeos??</h1>
      <p>chromeos is an operating system which is also a distribution of linux, which uses the linux kernel. it was made by google and it began as an open source project called "chromiumos". its repository is still available and still being worked on today.</p>
      <p>while most linux distributions are heavily focused on using files and the terminal locally, chromeos is much different because it mostly focuses on the internet and cloud services. thats why computers that use chromeos usually have little storage.</p>
      <h1>installation process</h1>
      <p>you can install chromeos for your computer. <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/os/chromeosflex/">google themselves give you a guide</a> on how to install it!</p>
      <h1>things i really liked</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>ease of use</li>
        <li>everything works out of the box</li>
        <li>simple for everyone</li>
        <li>built in sync with apps and files</li>
        <li>linux compatibility</li>
        <li>web apps</li>
        <li>familiar graphical interface</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>things i disliked</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>not a lot of customization</li>
        <li>settings are all over the place</li>
        <li>linux uses a lot of storage</li>
        <li>adaptive icons!!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>despite those bad things, i really like chromeos and the fact that it looks very similar to android, im happy that they are using linux and promoting open source, im using chromeos currently and i like it!!</p>
      <p>overall, i would give chromeos a score of 8.5/10. if you have the chance to try it out or buy a chromebook laptop, then please do so. thank you!!</p>
