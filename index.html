      <h2>isn't the best alternative to proprietary systems ubuntu?</h2>
      <img src="zorin-16-2.jpg" alt="screenshot of zorin os 16" width="490" style="float: right;">
      <p style="float: right; font-size:12px;"><b>photo credit: zorin os 16 screenshot, from linuxiac </b></p>
      <p>yes, and while i do admit that i love ubuntu and i really love its desktop environment, snap packages, and huge community support. <b>a brand new distro is here and it's doing cool things!!</b></p>
      <p><b>and why should you care/install it?</b> you see, zorin os is not a community made distro or a distro made by one person, it's a distro made by a company, the same way as canonical, just a little bit more independent. they not only offer the zorin os iso image for free, they also have a <b>paid version</b> that comes with a lot of open source software and technical support. they are a company from ireland</p>
      <h2>specs and stuff</h2>
      <p>it's simple!! the operating system runs the gnome desktop environment, albeit a bit modified to suit the looks of zorin os, which is very user-friendly and most people like that. the paid version also lets you change the style. (chrome os style, ubuntu gnome style, etc)</p>
      <p><b>overall, zorin os just got its crown for being a good beginner friendly distribution along with linux mint and ubuntu. it's great for most people and it's easier to use than other systems!</b> rating?? 9/10. <b>good distro</b>.</p>

      <h1>this ubuntu distro tries to look like windows... huh??</h1>
      <h2>10/03/2024</h2>

      <h2>what on earth are you talking about?? what is this?</h2>
      <img src="1-menu.webp" alt="screenshot of wubuntu" width="490" style="float: right;">
      <p style="float: right; font-size:12px;"><b>photo credit: wubuntu screenshot, from wubuntu website</b></p>
      <p><b>from the official <em>wubuntu</em> website:</b> <cite>Wubuntu is an operating system based on Ubuntu LTS that has a similar appearance to Windows using the open-source themes. Wubuntu also comes with a set of advanced tools called PowerTools that allows you to use features such as Control Panel and Windows-style network and general settings...</cite></p>
      <p>basically what this is is just a reskinned ubuntu-based distribution that tries its best to look as similar as possible to the proprietary operating system windows 11. which it does fairly well, and honestly props to the developers for doing so because it looks extremely similar to it.</p>
      <p>it looks like windows 11 and has most apps pre installed such as <em>microsoft edge</em>, <em>teams</em>, and much more, and while it does use the unix-like terminal, it still can be used fairly well without it.</p>
      <p>but other than that, it looks like a standard and classic ubuntu distro, with the kde plasma desktop environment modified to look like windows 11.</p>
      <p><b>the developers can get in legal trouble since it uses both intellectual property trademarks which are <em>ubuntu</em> and <em>windows</em>!! while it is an innovative operating system and it does things well, it can be problematic to use it.</b></p>
      <p>without disrespecting the hard work and contribution to the open source community, i'm going to say that if you are looking for an alternative to proprietary systems such as windows. i would suggest checking out <em>zorin os</em>. which is similar to mac os in the way that it's very simple to install and to use.</p>
      <h2>will you provide a download link?</h2>
      <p>i will not, and although you can find the iso file and website quickly on the internet, i think that they are in legal trouble and could be harmful to link it. <b>but that doesn't mean that i dislike the developers or authors behind it, i just think that they should do original stuff so that they won't get in trouble.</b></p>

      <h1>olpc: an interesting project that tried to bring linux to young people & schools</h1>
      <h2>25/02/2024</h2>
      <h2>tags: linux, distro, laptop, hardware, open source, free software</h2>
      <p><i>olpc: one laptop per child</i> was a non-profit initiative that consisted of giving cool and affordable laptops to children all around the world in order to give intelligence to those kids.</p>
      <p>this initiative began in the year 2005, it began in miami, florida. the sad thing about this initiative is that the average laptop price around that time was 1 thousand american dollars,which is a lot!! so that's why those guys had to create their own laptops which had to be extremely cheap, and they made the <i>olpc-xo</i> laptop, which is also known as the <i>100 american dollars laptop</i>, which, to be honest is very cheap. this initiative thus was funded by sponsors such as amd, ebay, google, red hat, and quanta. sadly, after really bad sales, this foundation shut down in 2014, which is bad because the laptops were very pretty</p>
      <h1>the laptop's' specs</h1>
      <ul>
          <li>size: smol honestly</li>
          <li>power option: solar panel</li>

      <p><img src="templeos.png" style="float: right;" alt="screenshot of templeos" width="600"></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px;"><sup><b>Terry A. Davis, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</b></sup></p>
      <p>templeos is an operating system made by software engineer <b>terry a davis</b>, who sadly had schizophrenia and would go on rants and insult people. but he did a very amazing operating system, despite his mental problems and fogness, he wrote the entire operating system by himself and made it both open source and public domain. he also made his own compiler and programming language <b>holy C</b>, which allows 3d graphics and other very cool things. sadly he became homeless and lived on his van for 3 years before passing away in an accident.</p>
      <p>he contributed a lot to the hobbyist programmer commnunity and helped people code stuff of their own, and despite problems and things terry said. his brilliance and knowledge of code is astonishing and amazing.</p>
      <h1>the operating system!!</h1>
      <p>templeos consists of mostly ascii characters arranged in such a way that they form a graphical user interface with both windows and a cursor. it has a few games built in which use the HOLY C language to work, sadly it doesnt have any networking or file sharing capabilities, which meant it was very hard to hack it or crack it. terry, would often suggest the people running templeos to dual boot to another open source operating system, like linux in order to both enjoy templeos and use network capabilities with linux.</p>

      <p>openstreetmaps is a pretty cool protocol that uses volunteers and other people that map the entire world, its been recorded in most, if not all, countries. thats what makes it great, its truly free, truly open, and helps people & communities.</p>
      <p>sadly in a lot of countries, data about people and culture, streets, etc, is often private and has to be asked from an external person and they arent open by themselves (not visible to the public)</p>
      <p>most openstreetmaps volunteers not only trace maps or find streets. sometimes they also do cool stuff like knowing the schedule, date, and more of public transport, knowing which places are and aren't safe.</p>
      <h1>openstreetmap is nice, why?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>open for anyone</li>
        <li>free and open data</li>
        <li>gratis (no price)</li>
        <li>volunteer-only</li>
        <li>offline use</li>
        <li>most streets are almost mapped</li>
        <li>volunteer-only method makes it faster to map places</li>
        <li>open source software</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>but... can i just volunteer myself and map stuff that hasnt been mapped?</b></p>
      <p>yes!! thats an awesome question, any person, no matter the knowledge or programming level, can contribute and trace any place, that makes it very valuable. because anyone can just go to any place (legally of course!!) and map it.</p>

      <h1>the chromium dinosaur offline and how open source projects make people think theyre from proprietary software</h1>
      <h2>09/02/2024</h2>
      <h2>tags: chromium, open source, dino game, google, chrome</h2>
      <p>chromium (or otherwise known as google chromium) is the open source/free software version <b>google chrome</b>, both google chrome and chromium share a lot of things together, since chromium was made by google themselves, google chrome isnt very different from chromium.</p>
      <p>but lets talk about whats in the title, and u know what it is!! if you are a google chrome or chromium user, u may notice that sometimes when you are offline, the site displayed will tell u that you are offline and will show cute dinosaur pixelart. well <b>this is an easter egg!!</b>, press space and u will begin to play a simple running game in which <b>u control the dinosaur and you are running through the northern mexican desert (which fun fact, dinosaurs lived there for thousands of years!!) jumping cactuses and crouching when u see pterodactyls.</b></p>
      <p>it became a staple of not only internet culture, but browser culture in general, while i dont think firefox uses the dino easter egg, a lot of chromium based browsers do, and im sure they have to keep a lot of chromium easter eggs bcus otherwise google could sue them since they arent following chromiums license (bsd-3).</p>
      <p><b>its a fun easter egg and a very nice thing since that game is completely open source too, yea!! thank you google!!!</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>sudo apt update [checks for updates of the packages used by linux, which, uses debian as the main virtual machine]</li>
        <li>sudo apt upgrade [upgrades the packages]</li>
        <li>[note: its important to always type these first two commands when opening a linux terminal, for they will keep everything stable]</li>
        <li>sudo apt install firefox-esr && sudo apt install chromium [the "&&" means that two commands will be executed one after another, in this case, both commands install firefox and vanilla chromium]</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin: 10px;"><sup><b>Rprpr, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</b></sup></p>
      <p>debian is one of the oldest operating systems that are based on linux, since its open source, its been built by the community and by a lot of developers, which means that theres a way of running on your android device without paying anything, not even rooting!!</p>
      <p>debian was made in 1994 by american engineer ian murdock, ever since, its been built by a lot of people and its still worked on, the current version is <b>bookworm, or debian 12</b>. and we will be using that version.</p>
      <h1>what we will need</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>andronix</li>
        <li>rvnc viewer</li>
        <li>termux (download it from the f-droid store)</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>basics of andronix!!</h1>
      <p>after installing andronix from the google play store, we will open it, we tap on the button that says "linux distribution", and then tap on "debian", then we tap on "desktop environment", using a desktop environment is useful because we will see the graphical interface.</p>
      <p>after this, a list of various desktop environments will appear. <b>what is a desktop environment?</b> in simple terms, its just the way graphical elements are displayed, its the graphic user interface that will be used. for this test, we will use "xfce", which is the most similar to windows and easiest to use.</p>
      <h1>setting up debian on termux</h1>
      <p>the next page will say "termux execution", and a text will be copied to your clipboard, this is useful.</p>
      <p>we copy that command and then open termux and paste it on the terminal and press enter. it will load and a list will start appearing, dont worry, this is normal, its installing.</p>
      <p>when the script finally gets installed, everything on the termux screen will be cleared and youll get a username like <b>root@localhost</b></p>
      <p>we go back to andronix and tap on the orange button that says "next", we have to be on a page that says "start vnc server", in that page, another command will be copied to our clipboard, we open termux while we are on the debian shell and paste it there, the command is <b>vncserver-start</b></p>
      <h1>using rvnc viewer</h1>
      <p>open <b>rvnc viewer</b> and on the main screen tap on the green button with the "+" sign. it will ask you to make a new connection, type "localhost:1" and give it a name.</p>
      <p>now we just tap on the green button that says <b>connect</b>.</p>
      <p>wait a few seconds and... now youre running debian on your phone!! its great!</p>
      <b>if there are problems or bugs, please visit <a href="https://andronix.app">andronix.app</a> and there are more docs there for help.</b>

      <p style="float: right; margin-right: 10px;"><sup><b>The chromium authors/Google, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</b></sup></p>
      <h1>what is chromeos??</h1>
      <p>chromeos is an operating system which is also a distribution of linux, which uses the linux kernel. it was made by google and it began as an open source project called "chromiumos". its repository is still available and still being worked on today.</p>
      <p>while most linux distributions are heavily focused on using files and the terminal locally, chromeos is much different because it mostly focuses on the internet and cloud services. thats why computers that use chromeos usually have little storage.</p>
      <h1>installation process</h1>
      <p>you can install chromeos for your computer. <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/os/chromeosflex/">google themselves give you a guide</a> on how to install it!</p>
      <h1>things i really liked</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>ease of use</li>
        <li>everything works out of the box</li>
        <li>simple for everyone</li>
        <li>built in sync with apps and files</li>
        <li>linux compatibility</li>
        <li>web apps</li>
        <li>familiar graphical interface</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>things i disliked</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>not a lot of customization</li>
        <li>settings are all over the place</li>
        <li>linux uses a lot of storage</li>
        <li>adaptive icons!!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>despite those bad things, i really like chromeos and the fact that it looks very similar to android, im happy that they are using linux and promoting open source, im using chromeos currently and i like it!!</p>
      <p>overall, i would give chromeos a score of 8.5/10. if you have the chance to try it out or buy a chromebook laptop, then please do so. thank you!!</p>

      <h3>music</h3>
      <ul><li>i dont have a favorite music genre, but i do enjoy the following genres: acoustic pop, folk pop, pop, country music, jazz (kind of), folk punk, rock/skate punk. although one key thing to mention is that all the music i listen to has no swearing, or at least isn't extremely explicit. i don't like explicit music, i believe it should be heavily limited or kept away from kids, children.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>i really like downloading free legal music from the internet, that way i support small creators and also get to listen to new or experimental music.</li></ul>
      <h3>diet (or food)</h3>
      <ul><li>ever since i was 17, i became a whole foods person. i only eat whole foods, i don't like the taste of extremely oily or sugary processed food, and i never did, sadly most people aren't aware of that. i also enjoy intermittent fasting, i usually fast for 23 hours and in 1 hour i have my meal, but sometimes my feeding window is bigger.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>i don't drink coca-cola or any other soda, coffee or juices (natural or not), i only drink water, i've found that that is a very good thing to do and it's always a good idea to drink water.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>i don't drink alcohol, i never did and never will. please don't try to influence me to do that. <b>unrelated but i also don't smoke or do drugs, i never did and i never will.</b></li></ul>
      <h3>clothing</h3>
      <ul><li>i can wear any type of clothing as long as it's:</li></ul>

          <li>not explicit</li>
          <li>not promoting hateful or political stuff</li>
          <li>not promoting proprietary software</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><li>although, i don't like wearing shorts, specially if i'm in nature, my legs need to be protected.</li></ul>

      <h3>other important things</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>i respect and i'm kind to everyone, yes even people who make proprietary software. i believe that open source can teach a lot and proprietary software can be used but open source must be encouraged always and promoted more. i am always open to make new friends, it doesn't matter who u are, if you are nice and kind, it's ok. if not oh well be a better person please</li>
          <li>i like living car-free, which means i like using public transport, walking, running, or getting a ride. that's always nice</li>
          <li>i don't drink alcohol, smoke, or do drugs and i never will</li>
          <li>i like to have no stress/being calm in life and always focus on what matters</li>
          <li>i love nature and hiking. walking on mountains and grass is so nice, i like flowers and cool animals, i don't like extremely urban cities a lot, i prefer nature and would someday like to live in a small town near a mountain</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>software</h3>
      <ul><li>i am a huge supporter and promoter of open source, it doesn't matter what operating system or device you're using, open source software must be present always. and must be expanded. it's good for the community and for humanity, i'm not only a software developer, i am an open source advocate.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>this mindset also applies to videogames. although any type of media can be open source, which in that case it's valid.</li></ul>
      <h3>how i use the internet</h3>
      <ul><li>unlike some open source fanatics, i don't really block any javascript or cookies, i find that to be weird. besides it's important to mention that websites aren't software (except if they are web apps), which means that it's fine if a website isn't open source.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>my browsers are the following: <b>chromium</b>, <b>firefox</b>, <b>google chrome</b>, and some other chromium-based browsers <b>(like microsoft edge)</b>, i think most of them can be considered open source since they are built on top of chromium.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>for browsing the internet, i use <b>duckduckgo</b>. which both chromium and firefox allow you to use, even google chrome.</li></ul>
      <h3>social media</h3>
      <ul><li>i don't use any social networking websites because the way that they use the interaction or the way they work is a little bit inconvenient for the things that i do, but that doesn't mean that i dislike them or i think they are unethical. some of them are, and some of them aren't, it really depends on its users. there are big differences between software and social media, unless it's a mobile client of course.</li></ul>
      <h3 id="programming-languages-i-know">programming languages i know</h3>
      <ul><li>the first programming language that i ever learned by myself was html & css, which ended up in what you're seeing right now, my website. i've also dealt with a little bit of javascript before but it's complex and honestly unless you are doing very complex web apps or websites, you shouldn't use javascript, but it's ok if you do.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>the second language i learned willingly and the one i enjoy the most, is python, i love its simple usage and the fact that its pre installed on most linux distributions and even bsd distributions. since it's a heavily popular programming language, its community is huge and you can find a lot of libraries for whatever you need.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>the third language i learned was golang, but very simple terminal apps or scripts.</li></ul>
      <h3>degree & college</h3>
      <ul><li>for privacy, i won't disclose the name of the college i studied in, but it was a private-owned community college. despite me being an open source enjoyer and contributing a lot to software, i studied <b>graphic design</b>, and maybe the website doesn't look like it, but the reason why it looks "messy" is because i like to give it a human feel, i don't like making it feel without soul.</li></ul>
